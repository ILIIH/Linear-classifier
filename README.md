# Linear-classifier
The linear classifier selects a weight for each weight, by which the value of each feature should be multiplied, and then added together. The class with the largest value is the prediction model.

In this repo, I will: practice calculating gradients of various multidimensional functions, implement gradient calculation through a linear model and softmax loss function, implement the process of training a linear classifier and select training parameters using an example.
